* Further Learning
Once you're comfortable with the basics, here's a recommended learning path:

** Help System
Emacs has a comprehensive built-in help system that you can access anytime:

Key help functions:
- ~describe-mode~ (~C-h m~): Help for current major mode
- ~describe-function~ (~C-h f~): Shows documentation for any Emacs function
- ~describe-key~ (~C-h k~): Shows what command a key combination runs
- ~describe-variable~ (~C-h v~): Shows documentation for any Emacs variable

Try this help example:
1. Press ~C-h k~ to start ~describe-key~
2. Press ~M-x~ when prompted for a key
3. A help buffer appears showing information about the ~execute-extended-command~ function
4. Press ~q~ to quit the help buffer

The help system is a powerful way to discover Emacs functionality and learn while you work.

** Built-in Emacs Tutorial
Access the interactive tutorial that helps you learn the basic modifier commands:
- Type ~C-h t~ or ~M-x help-with-tutorial~
- Note: ~C-g~ still works as expected and you can use the keypad for key combinations

** Mode-Specific Help
Get context-specific documentation for the mode you're currently using:
- Type ~C-h m~ (~describe-mode~) to view documentation for the current major mode
- Try this in different buffers (Org, Dired, Magit) to learn mode-specific commands

** Emacs Info System
Explore Emacs' comprehensive documentation:
- Type ~C-h i~ to access the Info directory
- Start with ~C-h m~ to learn about your current mode first

** Mode-Specific Manuals
For deeper understanding, work through (parts of) dedicated manuals in the Info system:
- Emacs (comprehensive guide to all Emacs features)
- Emacs Lisp (learn to customize Emacs with code)
- Dired
- Magit
- Org Mode

** Understanding the Configuration
To master this setup:
- Examine ~myinit.org~ and ~custom.org~ to understand the configuration
- Try making small modifications to customize it
