* Configuration
This configuration follows a core philosophy: stay close to vanilla Emacs while adding selective enhancements. This ensures:
- Compatibility with standard Emacs documentation and tutorials
- Transferable knowledge between this setup and other Emacs installations
- Stable experience with minimal conflicts between packages

** External Packages
The configuration uses a carefully selected set of packages:

- Meow: Modal editing
- Vertico/Marginalia/Orderless/Consult: Modern completion framework
- Embark: Context-sensitive actions on anything
- Avy: Fast navigation to visible text
- Magit: Git integration
- Expand-region: Smart text selection

Each package is configured quite minimally to work harmoniously with vanilla Emacs patterns.

** Customization
The configuration is designed to be extended. Here are two simple ways to customize your experience:

*** Keybindings
The safest and most recommended way to add your own keybindings is using the ~C-c~ prefix followed by a letter, which is reserved for user customizations by Emacs convention.

Example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Examples of how to define keybindings
  (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c t") #'your-favorite-function)
  (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c T") #'your-other-function)
#+end_src

For faster access to frequently used commands, you can add them to Meow normal state:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Example of how to bind a single key in normal mode
  (define-key meow-normal-state-keymap (kbd "T") #'your-other-function)
#+end_src

Call ~meow-cheatsheet~ to view currently assigned keys for a qwerty keyboard.

Remember that single keys are precious resources in normal mode, so use them wisely (e.g., create menus that get prime locations)!

*** Meow Keypad
Meow's keypad feature provides a convenient way to access ~C-c~ commands without holding down Ctrl:

1. Activate the keypad mode:
   - Press ~h~ from normal mode
   - Press ~SPC h~ from motion mode (e.g., in magit)
   - Press ~C-c h~ or ~F5 h~ from anywhere
2. Press any letter key (except x, c, g, h, m) and it will be translated to ~C-c~ + that letter

The reserved keys in keypad mode (x, c, g, h, m) have special functions within Meow.

*** Custom Menus
You can create your own menus to group related commands for specific workflows:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (easy-menu-define custom-menu global-map "Custom"
    '("Custom"
      ["Command 1" command-1 t]
      ("Submenu"
       ["Command 2" command-2 t]
       ["Command 3" command-3 t])))
#+end_src

Most importantly, this configuration encourages exploration - use the tools provided to discover and define your own optimal workflow.
