Welcome! This configuration combines (optional) modal editing efficiency with powerful discovery tools. The guide below will help you get started with essential concepts and commands.

* Essential Commands
- ~C-g~ (Control-g) :: Cancel current operation (very important!)
- ~M-x~ (Meta/Alt-x) :: Execute command (you can also use ~e~ in Space menu)
- ~SPC~ (type <space>) :: Space menu, the core entry point of this configuration
  In Space menu:
  - ~?~ :: open a cheatsheet with categories
  - ~C-h~ :: start vertical completion
  - Type the key directly, if you already know it
- ~?~ :: Cheatsheet for modal editing
- ~ESC~ :: Exit insert mode or cancel operations
